* About
A set of ~pixi~ environments to handle the sub-environments within the ~atomistic-cookbook~
** Usage
Clone the repository into this directory:
#+begin_src bash
# Most likely you'd want a fork though
git clone git@github.com:lab-cosmo/atomistic-cookbook.git
#+end_src
Now each example has a corresponding ~pixi~ environment to assist interactive work.
#+begin_src bash
pixi s -e lpr
cd atomistic-cookbook/examples/
python lpr.py
#+end_src
** Interactivity
Beyond the "production" environments for each example, we include environments
to assist working on new recipes.
*** Jupyter server
For an interactive writing experience, the ~jup~ environment may be used. This
can be used for interactive editing with the ~to-ipynb~ task:
#+begin_src bash
pixi r -e jup to-ipynb
#+end_src
Which will generate easy to work on variants of the ~.py~ files.
#+begin_src bash
pixi r -e jup serve
#+end_src
To get all the dependencies for a single example and the interactive usage, farm out to the environment of interest.
#+begin_src bash
pixi r -e lpr serve
#+end_src
