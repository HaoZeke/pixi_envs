* About
A set of ~pixi~ environments to handle development of the ~asv~ ecosystem.
** Usage
Clone the repository into this directory:
#+begin_src bash
# Most likely you'd want a fork though
git clone git@github.com:airspeed-velocity/asv.git
#+end_src
A good use-case for this is handling the version ranges required by ~asv~ in a
better way. For instance, the minimum GHA version is ~3.8~, so:
#+begin_src bash
pixi s -e min-gha
#+end_src
Or the lowest version altogether:
#+begin_src bash
pixi s -e min-ver
#+end_src
