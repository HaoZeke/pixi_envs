* About
Development environments with ~pixi~.
** Usage
- Get ~pixi~
- Setup the upstream repository below the corresponding ~pixi.toml~.
- Profit.
** Synchronization
For some reason, instead of using a bunch of hand-rolled ~rsync~ commands to
push and pull from remote machines in an ad-hoc set of ~pixi~ tasks, we use
[[https://mutagen.io/documentation/introduction/configuration/][mutagen]]. Basically this provides real-time, bi-directional syncing and handles
SSH connections automatically.
*** Usage
Instead of running a script manually, we manage the daemon:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# Start the background daemon (idempotent)
mutagen project start

# Monitor status (Check for conflicts or sync speed)
mutagen sync monitor

# View possible conflicts
mutagen project list

# Force a sync (e.g., after a remote run before closing laptop)
mutagen project flush

# Stop the daemon
mutagen project terminate
#+END_SRC

Conceptually this follows a series of out-of-build experiments:
